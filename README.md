# Vandals

Vandals was my idea of a Massively Multiplayer Online game about completing micro-games and exploring a 1-bit wasteland, before I understood the actual technology to make one.
The game is planned to be using Photon for realtime generation of the world and AJAX to save user data on a server.
The game traffic to the user data server is encrypted using Forge.
It was working on an older build of Construct 3, but right now, there are many issues. 

1. If you want to make this work for yourself, you'll need to resolve them. First we need a new workable version of the Photon plugin. I will be looking for my old licence and whether I can update. This is because currently, C3 does not launch the project because of a bug with the plugin.

2. Then, you need to host the server directory on a web server and use a database as well...

3. Finally, it is needed to create an app on the photon website and connect to it with the plugin.

If this is properly setup, it is possible to play the MMO. But it is very barebone and was only a proof of concept.
